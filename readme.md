# HALLOWEEN 2021 - operation spooky ðŸ‘»

## SETTING UP REPO
1. Pull repo into folder, name it `HalloweenBase.vr` or similar, as long as the end is `.vr`.  Ensure branch is set to `base`.
2. Copy/paste folder, name it to `HalloweenPart1.Tanoa` or similar.  Ensure branch is set to `part-1.Tanoa`.
3. Copy/paste folder, name it to `HalloweenPart2.CamLaoNam` or similar.  Ensure branch is set to `part-2.CamLaoNam`.
4. Copy/paste folder, name it to `HalloweenPart3.CamLaoNam` or similar.  Ensure branch is set to `part-3.CamLaoNam`.
5. Don't switch the branches around just pull/push m8.

## Operation Don't Break the Repo
* Common functionality like anomaly scripts, shared textures etc to be put in Base.
* Edits to Base `mission.sqm` disallowed.  Edits made to this file from upstream to be replicated in part branches manually.
* Merges to be made from `base` into `part-n` branches only.

## Operation Don't Forget The Operation
* Ideas to be put in the GitHub wiki.
* Don't put too much detail in, sketch out the main beats in the `Part n` pages.
* Keep the `MVP n` pages realistic.
* Put cool ideas in the `Cool ideas` page.  Don't inject them into the `Part n` pages.  Need to keep the scope down so we can deliver in horizontal slices like last year.

## Operation Don't Stress Out
* We won't get everything in.
* Time will catch up with us.
* That doesn't matter.
* **It will still be cool.**
