    Insignia framework
    First version by Bubbus, overhauled and improved by Gibbs.

    This file allows you to add new insignia groups for your mission.
    You can create your own insignia groups by creating a new file in the "insignia" folder and then including it in this file.

    This is considered to be an advanced feature - unless you know what you are doing, be careful when editing this file.
