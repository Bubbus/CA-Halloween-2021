/*

    Squad marker configuration file - Civilian side.

    Available commands:

    SET_SQUAD_VISIBILITY(SQUAD_NAME,<true or false>)
    -   If true, forces the squad marker to be visible.  If false, hides the squad's marker.

    HIDE_SQUAD(SQUAD_NAME)
    -   Hides the squad's marker, useful for zeus units, shot-down pilots, traitors...

    UNHIDE_SQUAD(SQUAD_NAME)
    -   Forces the squad's marker to be visible.  This is the default behaviour anyway.

    SET_SQUAD_ICON(SQUAD_NAME,ICON)
    -   Forces the squad's icon.  If this is not used, the marker will automatically change to show the squad's assets.
    Choices for ICON are:
        HELO, ANTIAIR, ARMOR, ARTILLERY, HQ, INFANTRY, REPAIR, MECHINF, MEDIC, MORTAR, MOTORINF, NAVAL, PLANE, RECON, SUPPLY, UNKNOWN

    SET_SQUAD_COLOUR(NAME,COLOUR)
    -   Sets the squad marker's colour.  The default colour is white.
    Choices for COLOUR are:
        RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, CYAN, MAGENTA, PINK, PURPLE, WHITE, LIGHTGREY, DARKGREY, BLACK, GREY, BROWN, KHAKI

	-------------------------------------------------
	
	INFO: If identical squad names are used between sides, you will need to manipulate them differently.  This will be fixed in future.  For now, see below:
	
	_group = GET_SQUAD_ON_SIDE(NAME,SIDE)
	-	Finds a group with the given name on the given side.  Once this is done, you may use '_group' alongside any of the "DIRECT" versions of the commands above.
	
	Example:
	
	_group = GET_SQUAD_ON_SIDE(ZEUS,west);
	SET_SQUAD_IMPORTANT_DIRECT(_group,true);
	HIDE_SQUAD_DIRECT(_group);
